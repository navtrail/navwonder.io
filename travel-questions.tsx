/* globals it:readonly, describe:readonly, expect: readonly */

// I'm adding 'describe' and 'expect' as well, as they are commonly used with 'it' in testing frameworks.
// If the actual code uses a different testing framework or has a different way of handling these variables,
// this declaration might need to be adjusted.

// The rest of the original code would go here.  Since it was omitted, I cannot provide a complete file.
// However, this addresses the specific issue raised in the updates.

// Example usage (assuming the original code had something like this):

describe("Travel Questions Component", () => {
  it("should render without errors", () => {
    // expect(true).toBe(true); // Example assertion
  })
})
