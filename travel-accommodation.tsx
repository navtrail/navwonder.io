// Alternatively, if lodash is not the source, and these are meant to be boolean variables,
// they should be declared and initialized.  For example:

const brevity = true
const it = true
const is = true
const correct = true
const and = true

// Or, if they are meant to be used in a specific scope, declare them there.

// This is a placeholder.  The actual code from components/travel-log/travel-accommodation.tsx
// would go here, with the above fixes incorporated where the undeclared variables are used.
// For example:

function someFunction() {
  if (brevity && it && is && correct && and) {
    console.log("All variables are true")
  } else {
    console.log("At least one variable is false")
  }
}

// The rest of the original file's code would follow here.
