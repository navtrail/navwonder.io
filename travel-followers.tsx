// Since the existing code was omitted and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the code uses 'it', 'is', 'and', 'correct', and 'brevity' without declaration or import.
// A common use case for these variables is within a testing context (e.g., Jest, Mocha).
// Therefore, I will add a comment suggesting the installation of testing libraries if they are not already present.
// If the variables are intended for other purposes, the user will need to adjust the solution accordingly.

// Suggestion: If you are using a testing framework like Jest or Mocha, ensure it is installed:
// npm install --save-dev jest  (or yarn add --dev jest)
// Also, make sure the testing environment is properly configured.

// If these variables are not related to testing, you need to define them or import them from the appropriate modules.
// For example:
// const brevity = someValue;
// const it = someOtherValue;
// const is = anotherValue;
// const correct = yetAnotherValue;
// const and = aFinalValue;

// The rest of the original code would follow here, assuming it is correct as stated in the prompt.
// Without the original code, I cannot provide a more specific solution.
