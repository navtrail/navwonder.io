// This component is intentionally left blank as the original file was marked as correct and the updates indicate undeclared variables.  Since the original code is not provided, I cannot determine the correct import or declaration for these variables.  A placeholder is provided below to indicate where the fix would be implemented if the original code was available.

// Placeholder for fix:
// import { brevity, it, is, correct, and } from 'some-library';
// OR
// const brevity = someValue;
// const it = someValue;
// const is = someValue;
// const correct = someValue;
// const and = someValue;

// Actual component code would go here, using the above variables.
